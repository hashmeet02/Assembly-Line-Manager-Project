The whole OOP 345 course regarding Object Oriented Programming was highly informative and insightful to develop coding skills in C++. Especially the finally project helped me a lot to sum up whatever I have learnt not only in this semester, but the previous semesters as well. But most importantly of all, the guidance of my prof, Michael Huang was exactly what I needed to enhance my coding style. The workshopd did hurt my grades a little in the beginning, but the detailed feedback from the prof helped me improve my understanding for the course dramatically.
